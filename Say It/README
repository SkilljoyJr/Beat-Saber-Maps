Originally was going to use V3 lighting from the Lattice environment, but, as far as I can tell, Remapper brakes the event blocks for specifically Lattice and I ended up doing everything in Unity.

Please do not spam functions like I did and use for loops I'm so bad. The claps too, could have used a rand field of some kind but I already made the same effect in the Lattice environment so I just copied the positions and made particles similar to one I made with the cubes in Unity.
