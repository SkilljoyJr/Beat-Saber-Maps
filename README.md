# Beat-Saber-Maps
Please read the README found within each song folder first!

Collection of assets used to make my maps for other people's viewing and use. No need to ask for permission to use assets, but feel free to reach out to me on my discord, singlefatherof0, if you have questions.


Why I made this repo: 

I've never been without guilt for using other's people work no matter how much I modify it. I at least want to disclose what I used and point to who I got something from and will do so here for now on. 

My journey of making Beat Saber maps is built upon the shoulders of many map makers that I look up to. I've learned extensively from disecting other people's work. Maps made by Fatulation, Elecast, Jevk, Swifter, and Mawntee in particular, are maps I've spent a lot of time digging through to learn how to made their projects and probably in that order in terms of time and knowledge gained. When learning a new concept I've almost always copied an asset of some sort, note patterns, lighting effects, noodle code, and currently shaders, and experimented with them until I understand the thought process of making said asset so I could get to a point of making my own based off what I learned. I never would of learned what I know without the above people mentioned and I especially praise Jevk, Swifter, and Mawntee for being so open out their work, giving in-depth guides for so much, and being incredibly ready to help community members like me. I won't be as big or dedicated as these people but I hope to be able to at least help someone.
