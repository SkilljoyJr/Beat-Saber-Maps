The code I wrote for these scripts is absolutely horrible to the eyes and should have used extensive use of functions whereas I used ctrl h for editing everything. I do not recommend anyone to copy the format in which I did everything, I suggest to just use it to learn techniques I used for effects such as the vibration, FOV, etc.

This map took 3.5 months to develop. As a result, in the beginning I used Mawntee's Javascript template, but learned Swifter's Remapper in TypeScript by the end of the project and as a result this map is an abomination that uses both, do not do this. I will only use remapper in the future and I recommend you do too with the huge exception that Mawntee's template is very easy to use and very informative. If you are someone who does not know to program, I would start using Mawntee's script and eventually transition to Remapper because Remapper's documentation is built for people who already are programmers unfortunately.
